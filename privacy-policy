Privacy Policy for EzySaveMoneyManager

Last updated: December 5, 2023

Welcome to EzySaveMoneyManager ("us", "we", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our iOS application (the "App").

Information We Do Not Collect

We want to assure you that EzySaveMoneyManager does not collect any personal information from users unless explicitly provided by users voluntarily. The App does not require users to create an account or provide personal details such as names, addresses, or contact information.

Automatically Collected Information

While you use the App, certain non-personal information may be automatically collected for analytical and statistical purposes. This information may include device information, app usage statistics, and technical details. However, none of this information personally identifies users.

Data Storage

Any data collected is stored locally on the user's device and is not transmitted to our servers or third parties.

Third-Party Services

The App may integrate third-party services (such as analytics tools), but these services are used for aggregate, non-personal information to help us understand user behavior and improve the App's performance.

In-App Purchases

If the App offers in-app purchases, payment information is processed securely through the Apple App Store, and we do not have access to or store any payment-related information.

Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be notified of any changes within the App.
